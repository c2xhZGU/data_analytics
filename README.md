## financial data analytics

1. the file returns_histogram.ipynb contains a simple function for providing visual analytical insight on fundamental time series company data. I've used a dataset with ~5 years of data on large cap US stocks. I've created a function that provides me with a histogram of the future price return outcomes of stocks with specific characteristics (ignoring the price returns already in the dataset). The function has 3 inputs, metric, value, and timeframe. Metric allows me to choose a ratio, value is the minimum value to be observed to be used to classify the stock is in the universe I am interested in, and timeframe is the length of time over which to calculate the price change into the future. For example, I want to know what the distribution of returns has been (histogram of price changes) for stocks that have had price/epsntm [Metric, string] ratios greater than 30 [value, float] over a 6 month [timeframe, integer] timespan after the metric is observed. This is one histogram, not one per stock. I've used the following metrics: price/epsNTM, entrVal/ebitdaNTM, entrVal/salesNTM, roe and pB. The output is a chart and a data.frame of binned returns and their frequencies.
